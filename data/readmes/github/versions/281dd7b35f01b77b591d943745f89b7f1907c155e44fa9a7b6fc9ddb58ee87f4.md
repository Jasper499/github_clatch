# Mika

**An AI assistant on your phone: say what you need, and it works your apps and the web until it's done.**

It works on a hidden background screen, so you can keep using your phone.

<sub>Several demos use apps popular in China: WeChat is the main messaging app there, and Xiaohongshu (RED) is a lifestyle and social platform. Mika isn't tied to them; it works with any app or website on your phone.</sub>

## Why Mika

| | |
|---|---|
| 📱 **Leaves your screen alone** | Opens apps, taps, types and scrolls on a separate background screen while you use your phone as usual; tap the small live view whenever you want to watch |
| 🧩 **Works with any app** | Looks at the screen and finds buttons the way a person does: no app APIs, no per-app integration |
| 🌐 **Call it from any web page** | In the built-in browser, say what you want on the page you're reading and it works right there; touch the page and it stops |
| 🧠 **Gets better with use** | Remembers the preferences you tell it, and turns tasks it finishes into skills so next time is faster and steadier |
| 🔒 **Your data stays on your phone** | There is no Mika server; use your own model API key, or sign in with a ChatGPT, xAI or OpenRouter account |
| 🆓 **Open source and free** | Apache-2.0, all code public |

## Get started in three steps

1. **Install**: download the APK from [Releases](https://github.com/wangzan101/Mika/releases/latest).
2. **Connect a model**: in Settings › Model, pick a provider and enter an API key, or just sign in with an account ([models and sign-in](docs/models.en.md)).
3. **To operate phone apps**: follow the "Set up phone control" wizard in Settings and pair wireless debugging on the phone once ([setup guide](docs/setup-guide.en.md)). Skip this if you only want chat, web and files.

Then try saying: "Set alarms for 9:40 and 10:00 tomorrow morning" or "Check the weather at 8 every morning and tell me only if it will rain".

## What it can do

| | |
|---|---|
| **Operate apps** | Reads long lists and chat histories, taps and types, shares text into apps; hands logins, verification codes and payments to you |
| **Browse the web** | A built-in desktop-class browser that keeps you signed in, reads pages, downloads and uploads; paces itself and hands block pages to you |
| **Your current screen** | Double-tap the floating capsule to send the screen you're looking at: "how should I reply?", "note this down" |
| **Schedules and conditions** | "Remind me at 9 tomorrow", "do this every Friday"; runs on time in the original conversation |
| **Jump in or stop anytime** | Keep talking while a task runs to add or correct things (long-press to withdraw or edit one Mika hasn't picked up yet); after a stop it reports where it got to, and "continue" picks up from there |
| **Hold to talk** | Hold the chat input to speak and edit the words before sending; long-press the floating capsule to speak and release to send. Uses the phone’s built-in speech recognition, or a provider’s speech model if it has none |
| **Files and computing** | A Linux sandbox per conversation runs Python, Node and shell on the files you send (arm64) |
| **From your computer** | AI tools on your computer can hand Mika tasks through CLI + Skill or MCP ([use Mika from a computer](docs/computer.en.md)) |

By default Mika runs in **Ask mode**: it checks with you only before spending money (placing orders, paying) and just does everything else. You can switch to **Autonomous mode** instead. See [Ask and Autonomous](docs/modes.en.md).

For how each of these works and the finer details, see [features in detail](docs/features.en.md).

## Which phones

| | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Chat, web, files | Android 11 or later |
| Operating phone apps | Android 12 or later; **Android 14+ recommended** (the background screen has its own focus, so it doesn't get in the way of your typing on the main screen) |
| Linux sandbox | arm64 devices |

Not sure your phone is up to it? Run Settings › Recovery & repair › **Compatibility self-check**: 12 checks in about a minute, and you can [send us the results](https://github.com/wangzan101/Mika/issues/new?template=device-report.yml) in one tap.

## Privacy & safety

- **There is no Mika server**: what you say and what's on your screen go only to the model provider you set up.
- API keys and memories are stored encrypted on the phone; conversations and run records stay on the device; update checks only contact GitHub.
- Operating third-party apps and websites automatically may break their terms of service, so use your own judgment. For anything important, use Ask mode and check the results. See the [disclaimer](docs/disclaimer.en.md).

<summary><b>FAQ</b></summary>

**Wireless debugging turned itself off?** Android turns it off when you change Wi-Fi or restart. With your permission, Mika turns it back on by itself; if it still can't connect, go back to "Set up phone control" and pair again.

**Can't find wireless debugging on my phone?** Some phone systems leave it out. You can start the phone helper from a computer over USB instead; see the [setup guide](docs/setup-guide.en.md).

**Some screens can't be read or captured?** Pages like payments and password entry block screenshots, so Mika asks you to take over there.

**Can I use a model running on my own computer?** Yes: pick "Custom" as the provider and enter its address on your local network.

**Is the app in English?** Yes. The app UI comes in English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian and Indonesian, follows your system language, and can be switched in Settings › Language. The built-in app and website knowledge is written in Chinese, but that doesn't limit you: the model reads it fine, and you can talk to Mika in English.

**Where do updates come from?** Only from this repository's [Releases](https://github.com/wangzan101/Mika/releases); you can also upgrade in the app from About › Check for updates.

More answers are in the [FAQ](docs/faq.en.md).
